    print("Knee high grass sways in the dappled sunlight of the forest glade; you stand at its boundary and adjust your pack to ease the soreness in your shoulders. You have travelled far to find this place. Some meters before you through the waving grass lies a hillock, low but wide. Very wide in fact. From your vantage, the hillock appears to be perfectly round and to dominate the clearing. Festooned with the dancing grass, its gentle slope begins to rise from the ground near the treeline on all sides. With a practiced eye, you observe the vegetation bordering the glade directly opposite you and reckon the distance to be at least 250 meters, perhaps more. Casting a quick glance behind you into the warm shadow of the  forest, you step forward and wade into the grass. Insects buzz and birds cry in the day's summer heat; your progress sends an unseen animal rushing from your path with a frantic urgency that you find disquieting in a way you can't quite explain. The hillock's rise is almost imperceptibly gradual as you trek across it, searching. It takes you several hours to locate what you came for, what based on the rumors and happenings in the local settlements, you knew you would find. Moving through the grass near the hillock's heighest point, you almost stumble into what appears to be a jagged hole, black as pitch and about three meters across at its widest point. Soil and grass bound by clinging roots hang over its yawning lip; removing your pack and laying it aside well back from the edge, you shuffle closer with one foot forward, testing the ground. With your lead foot at the precipice, you lean your head forward and peer down. You can see nothing. No sound or smell rises from the opening. A languid breeze wafts up and plays over you skin, cool to the point of cold and bone dry. You sense only a vastness of space, and darkness which, unlike that of an unlit room or a moonless night, is unknowable and somehow alien. Returning to your pack, you retrieve a small camp shovel and begin to dig. There is a resounding clink as the tip of your shovel immediately hits something solid buried only a few centimeters under the earth. Clearing away a small patch of dirt and grass, you find a smooth, matte surface the color of sun-bleached bone. You clear away more dirt and vegetation, widening the bare patch and revealing more of the same smooth, white material. You expect that this would be the case if you were to clear the entire hillock; with a spine tingling creep you realize that it's not a hillock at all but the topmost portion of a colossal dome. You scramble further away from the opening. You imagine how the gentle slope of the structure's surface must continue under the ground in all directions, under the forest and its tangling roots, sloping down and down and down, the dome itself kilometers wide, containing a vastness of space, so close beneath your feet. Your heart rate slows as the shock of your revelation is tempered by excitement. This is what you came all this way for. Filled with new resolve, you return the shovel to your pack and withdraw a mallet, a piton, and a belted leather harness. Using the mallet, you drive the piton into the white material, muttering the syllables that will engage its operation as you work. The syllables have no meaning to you but feel rough and unpleasant in your mouth. As you turn to don the harness, you spit out a small mouthful of blood. Once donned, you check the harness's straps and connections for fit, feeling the ingots of metal concealed in the straps and muttering more discordant syllables that bring blood to your mouth. Spitting once more, you withdraw a torch and your flint and steel from you pack before you shoulder it. You light the torch. Crouching near the opening, you raise your arm over the abyss, torch in hand. For a moment you let it hang suspended, shedding its fitful, guttering light. You let it fall. It tumbles into the dark with a pennon's whipping snap. Leaning your head over the edge you watch its progress, down and down, and you count. Five seconds. Still it falls, tumbling, receding. Ten seconds. It is only a shrinking point of light now; you cannot see it roll and turn. Fifteen seconds. The torch is a spark cast from flame, burning impotently against a swelling darkness. Surely it will reach the bottom soon. At the count of twenty, you detect a subtle change as the torch at last reaches the floor below. It is a bright garnet chip surrounded by the thinnest penumbral cocoon of glowing orange, so small as to almost be invisible. You stand, grim at the prospect of what awaits you. By now, the sun is beginning to set and the world glows red with the day's fading light. You move to stand at the edge of the opening, the anchored piton a few paces behind you. You speak one final syllable that jangles, painful and bitter in your mouth. Tasting iron, you feel your harness strain slightly as a sibilant tension fills the air and rattles something in your head, just beyond the range of your hearing. You look down into the yawning maw before you. Once again a breeze, so cool as to be cold, rises to play over your skin. You spare a final glance for the grassy glade and the deepening twilight. You tip forward and fall into darkness. ")
