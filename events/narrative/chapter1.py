    print("""...You move to stand at the edge of the opening, the anchored piton a few paces behind you. You speak one final syllable that jangles, painful and bitter in your mouth. Tasting iron, you feel your harness strain slightly as a sibilant tension fills the air and rattles something in your head, just beyond the range of your hearing. You look down into the yawning maw before you. Once again a breeze, so cool as to be cold, rises to play over your skin. You spare a final glance for the grassy glade and the deepening twilight. You tip forward and fall into darkness. """)
