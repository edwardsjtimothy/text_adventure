# text_adventure
Text adventure RPG built in Python


**Development Goals**

1. refactor combat functions in adventurers.py into one class agnostic function
2. contain maneuver check in enemy constructor in a function so that the same block of code isn't repeated. 
    a. better understand Python variable scoping
